//! Tauri-independent foundations shared by the desktop Host and the headless CLI.
//!
//! Nothing in this crate may depend on `tauri` / `wry` / `tao`; the desktop
//! shell re-exports these modules as `agentero_lib::core::*` so both binaries
//! share one storage/plumbing layer. [`features`] holds the tauri-free domain
//! services (catalog, vault, import, wiki, …), re-exported by the Host as
//! `agentero_lib::features::*`; host-side effects (event emit, job spawns)
//! route through [`app_handle::HostHooks`].
